# NOTICE

This is an private built API but I made it open source now, so the code may not be that generalized.

It is a QQ API written in Python based on 小栗子 QQ frame with HTTPAPI plugin installed, so you will have those installed to make it work.

# USAGE

<strong> Do make sure you have started 小栗子 QQ frame with HTTPAPI plugin installed </strong>
<strong> If you haven't done that, go to https://bbs.xiaolz.cn/forum.php </strong>

## 1. edit the config file

## 2. import this api file in other code or in console

# Functions for now
