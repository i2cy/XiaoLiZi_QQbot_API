# XiaoLiZi_QQbot_API

# NOTICE

This is an private built API but I made it open source now, so the code may not be that generalized.

It is a QQ API written in Python based on 小栗子 QQ frame with HTTPAPI plugin installed, so you will have install those above to make it work.

# USAGE

<strong> Do make sure you have started 小栗子 QQ frame with HTTPAPI plugin installed </strong>
